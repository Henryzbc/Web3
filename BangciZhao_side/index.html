                <p class="description">People with deformities often face many challenges in life. They might struggle
                    with mobility, finding employment, and being accepted by society. For example, a person with a
                    severe physical deformity may have difficulty using public transportation or accessing certain
                    buildings due to lack of accessibility. They need our support and understanding to live with
                    dignity.</p>

                <p class="description">Left-behind children lack the care and companionship of their parents. They might
                    have to take on more responsibilities at home, such as looking after younger siblings or doing
                    household chores. In some cases, they may also face difficulties in their studies due to lack of
                    guidance. For instance, a left-behind child might have to walk several kilometers to school every
                    day and then come home to an empty house. They need our attention and love to grow up healthily.</p>

                <p class="description">Empty nesters often feel lonely and helpless. They might miss the company of
                    their children and worry about their own health and well-being. For example, an empty nester may
                    have trouble keeping up with household maintenance or feel isolated without regular interaction.
                    They need our company and care to enjoy their later years.</p>

                <p class="description">Homeless people face the harsh reality of living without a stable home. They
                    might endure extreme weather conditions, lack access to proper hygiene facilities, and struggle to
                    find enough food. For instance, a homeless person may have to sleep on the streets in the cold
                    winter or go days without a proper meal. They need our compassion and assistance to get back on
                    their feet.</p>

                <p class="description">Disabled veterans have sacrificed a lot for our country. They might deal with
                    physical and mental scars from their service. For example, a disabled veteran may have lost a limb
                    or be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. They need our respect and support to lead a
                    fulfilling life after their service.</p>

                <p class="description">Elderly people living in poverty face many hardships. They might have limited
                    resources to meet their basic needs. For example, an elderly person in poverty may not be able to
                    afford proper medical care or nutritious food. They need our help to live a comfortable and
